## H2 Inspiration
As fans of classic, side-scrolling games such as Super Mario Bros, we decided to experiment with a similar idea and create a game of our own. We created a two-dimensional, side-scrolling game that demonstrated the similar capabilities as a standard side-scrolling game.

## H2 What it does
It provides enjoyment to fans of two-dimensional, side-scrolling games.

## H2 How I built it
This project was created using the two-dimensional capabilities of Unity.

## H2 Challenges I ran into
All of our team members came into this hackathon with no experience of Unity and little knowledge of C#. As a result, the project ran into many problems. Due to our limited scope in regards to Unity, we were forced to cut several additional features.

## H2 Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Building a game from scratch with my team members, learning to work in a stressful environment, and time management.

## H2 What I learned
Unity

## H2 What's next for Uknighty
Uknighty undoubtedly opened doors for our teammates by allowing us to learn more about the Unity Engine. We plan to implement much more to our game, such as randomly generated enemies, better textures, and more combat features that were unfortunately cut during the event.
